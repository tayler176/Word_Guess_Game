Word Letter Guess games

You have 10 guesses to figure out the letter that the computer has selected. You are unable to waste guesses on anything other than letters.

The one problem I couldnt figure out how to limit the player to guessing the same letter once per game. the player will be alerted that they already selected that letter but will be counted against them anyway.
